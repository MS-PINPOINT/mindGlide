# MindGlide

**Ultrafast segmentation of realâ€‘world brain MRI for multipleâ€‘sclerosis patients â€” any modality, any quality.** Built with PyTorchÂ +Â MONAI and trained onÂ >23â€¯000 scans.

## QuickÂ start

```bash
# clone code **and** pretrained checkpoint in one shot
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/MS-PINPOINT/mindGlide.git
cd mindGlide
```

If you already cloned without the flag:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

This pulls the model repo from the Huggingâ€¯Face Hub and places
`models/_20240404_conjurer_trained_dice_7733.pt` in the workspace.

PyTorch trained models are stored on Huggingface:
`https://huggingface.co/MS-PINPOINT/mindglide/tree/main`

Trained models are shared in the `models` directory.
They are trained on the datasets explained in the paper [**Nature Communications (2025)**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-58274-8#citeas).


> **Requirements**
> â€¢ GitÂ â‰¥Â 2.13
> â€¢ GitÂ LFSÂ â€” oneâ€‘time setup: `git lfs install`
> â€¢ Docker
> â€¢ *(Optional)*Â Apptainer/Singularity for HPC environments

## Run in Docker (GPU)

```bash
docker run --gpus all \  
  --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 -it \  
  -v $PWD:/mnt \  
  mspinpoint/mindglide:may2024 <your_scan>.nii.gz
```

For Singularity/Apptainer, build once then run:

```bash
singularity run --nv \
  --bind $PWD:/mnt \
  /path/to/mind-glide_latest.sif <your_scan>.nii.gz
```

## Fineâ€‘tuning

Use the scripts in `scripts/` as a template. Start with a low learning
rate (e.g.â€¯1eâ€‘3) to avoid catastrophic forgetting â€” shipped models were
trained withÂ 1eâ€‘2.

---

## Model weights

The primary checkpoint lives in this repo at:

```
models/_20240404_conjurer_trained_dice_7733.pt
```

Additional or legacy checkpoints are archived in the [Huggingâ€¯Face model repo](https://huggingface.co/MS-PINPOINT/mindglide).
