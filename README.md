S<mark>e</mark>g<mark>m</mark>enting clinical <mark>M</mark>R<mark>I</mark> scans of <mark>m</mark>ultiple sclerosis patients of any quality and <mark>mo</mark>dality

MindGlide is a deep learning model for ultrafast segmentation of real-world, brain MRI scans of any modality and any quality. MindGlide does not require any extra preprocessing or postprocessing. It can be used for research applications, such as lesion segmentation, brain structure quantification, and brain atrophy analysis.

MindGlide is an open source PyTorch model built with the MONAI framework
on more than 23,000 scans from multiple sclerosis patients. MindGlide
quantifies the volume of brain structures and lesions using by ultrafast
segmentation on GPU hardware.

## Quick Start

##Â Requirements

You will need to install the following software:

- Git
- Docker
- Git LFS (Large File Storage)
- AppTainer (optional)

### Installation

MindGlide can be run without installation using container technology. The
following command will pull the latest version of the container from
GitHub's Large File Storage (LFS) and run it interactively:

`git clone https://github.com/MS-PINPOINT/mindGlide.git`

PyTorch trained models are stored in the `models` directory. The
following command will download the latest version of the models:

`git lfs pull`

You can use Docker or Apptainer to run the container. To start testing
MindGlide, run the following command:

```
cd mindGlide
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/mindGlide -w /mindGlide armaneshaghi/ms-pinpoint/mind-glide:latest {name_of_nifti_file}
```

You need to replace `{name_of_nifti_file}` with the name of the NIfTI file. For example, if you want to run the test file `test.nii.gz`, you can run the following command:

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/mindGlide -w /mindGlide armaneshaghi/ms-pinpoint/mind-glide:latest test.nii.gz
```

`test.nii.gz` will be a brain MRI file.

Docker container is used for testing the model. If you want to use the
container on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters, you can use
Apptainer (formerly known as Singularity). See [Apptainer](https://apptainer.org/) documentations for details.

### Usage

#### With Docker

'''
docker run --gpus all run \
--gpus all --ipc=host \
--ulimit memlock=-1 -it \
-v $PWD:/mnt \
armaneshaghi/mind-glide:latest test/20150610_flair.nii.gz
'''

#### With Apptainer (Singularity)

Make sure that you have pulled the repository with `git lfs`
